# main-project
This project aims to implement urban traffic control by dynamically adjusting signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions at each junction lane. In contrast to traditional systems, our approach utilizes advanced sensors, machine learning algorithms, and image processing to monitor the number of vehicles waiting at each lane and the length of the waiting traffic queue. This ensures that green signals are allocated efficiently, optimizing traffic flow and minimizing congestion. By reducing wait times for lanes with fewer or shorter vehicles, our system enhances overall road safety and promises to significantly improve urban transportation efficiency. This innovative approach makes cities more accessible and livable for all. we utilize the Haar Cascade classifier to sense real-time traffic conditions at intersections. The escalating number of vehicles, coupled with the slower pace of development in city infrastructures, exacerbates traffic management challenges. Manual efforts alone are insufficient to address these issues. Our solution, a machine-based dynamic traffic control system, offers a more effective alternative. Unlike static systems, our project adapts to changing traffic conditions, optimizing flow and preventing road congestion.
